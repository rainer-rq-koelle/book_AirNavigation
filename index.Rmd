# Preface {-}

This book captures a series of lecture notes that I put together over the years.
These notes are targeted at individuals - novices or professionals - that have an interest in learning about Air Navigation and Air Traffic Management.

These notes are put together as a lessons learnt from different projects.
This also means there is no ultimate timeline for finishing this book.
Please provide feedback on missing parts or obvious mistakes. I will try to update the notes accordingly.

For any suggestion or comment contact: rainer.koelle@eurocontrol.int.

Enjoy the read!
